      <h2>Leadership and Team Development</h2>
      <p>Building and managing high-performing engineering teams is a key part of my role. I have mentored and managed engineers from various disciplines, ensuring that we build a collaborative, innovative, and efficient work culture.</p>
      <p>For example, I led a cross-functional team to develop and deploy robotic systems in multiple regions, ensuring seamless collaboration and continuous learning for team members. This involved tailored training and providing opportunities for growth within the organization.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="technical-innovation-prototyping">
      <h2>Technical Innovation & Prototyping</h2>
      <p>Driving technical innovation is at the core of my work. I have led multiple prototyping projects to test and refine cutting-edge technologies. These efforts have led to innovative products that have had real-world impacts.</p>
      <p>In one project, I compared different underfloor insulation techniques, building a test cell to evaluate the effectiveness of various methods. This hands-on, data-driven approach has been instrumental in shaping successful engineering solutions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="project-management-execution">
      <h2>Project Management & Execution</h2>
      <p>I have successfully managed and delivered multiple complex engineering projects from concept to completion, overseeing timelines, budgets, and technical outcomes. This includes working with diverse teams across software, hardware, and product management to ensure alignment with company goals.</p>
      <p>One key project was the development of a robot fleet for deployment in Europe. I managed the end-to-end process, from initial concept through to operation, ensuring that the project met all technical and business objectives.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-driven-decision-making">
      <h2>Data-Driven Decision Making</h2>
      <p>Throughout my career, I have focused on using data to drive decision-making. By analyzing performance metrics and failure data, I have been able to optimize processes and improve product reliability.</p>
      <p>For instance, by analyzing robot faults, I found that a large percentage could be fixed by training the team, while others required upgrades to the robots themselves. These insights allowed for targeted solutions that improved both the robot performance and operational efficiency.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="stem-outreach">
      <h2>STEM Outreach & Community Engagement</h2>
      <p>Outside of my professional work, I am passionate about inspiring the next generation of engineers. I actively engage in STEM outreach activities, mentoring young people, and working to break down barriers to entry in engineering fields.</p>
      <p>My outreach efforts include organizing local workshops, collaborating with schools to bring hands-on robotics experiences to students, and participating in career talks to encourage diverse talent to pursue careers in engineering and technology.</p>
