    <!-- Leadership & Team Development Section -->
    <section id="leadership-and-team-development">
      <h2>Leadership & Team Development</h2>
      <p>Building and leading high-performing, diverse teams is a cornerstone of my professional journey. I excel at fostering collaboration, nurturing talent, and creating inclusive environments where innovation thrives.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Scaling Q-Bot Operations Across Europe</h3>
        <p><strong>Situation:</strong> As Head of Robot Operations, I was responsible for managing a growing fleet of robots and operational teams across multiple countries.</p>
        <p><strong>Actions:</strong> My team implemented training programmes for installers, carried out strategic analysis to reduce robot faults, and worked collaboratively to optimise operations.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Achieved a 19% reduction in critical failures and enhanced team cohesion across international markets.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Launching the "Robot Guru" Programme</h3>
        <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Fault rates among robots were creating inefficiencies in operations.</p>
        <p><strong>Actions:</strong> My team developed and delivered a programme to upskill operational staff, improving fault diagnosis and repair capabilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Faults reduced by 33%, improving overall robot performance and customer satisfaction.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Diversity & Mentorship Initiatives</h3>
        <p><strong>Situation:</strong> I recognised the need to build an inclusive and supportive environment within Q-Bot’s growing engineering teams.</p>
        <p><strong>Actions:</strong> My team and I mentored engineers, promoted internal development, and championed recruitment strategies to bring diverse perspectives into the team.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Cultivated a collaborative, high-performing team where multiple members advanced to senior roles.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Technical Innovation & Prototyping Section -->
    <section id="technical-innovation-prototyping">
      <h2>Technical Innovation & Prototyping</h2>
      <p>Driving innovation through prototyping and rapid iteration has been a defining aspect of my career. I thrive on taking ideas from concept to reality, ensuring they meet customer and market demands.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Transitioning to Batch Production</h3>
        <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Q-Bot needed to scale its production from custom-built prototypes to externally manufactured batches.</p>
        <p><strong>Actions:</strong> My team led the design and testing process, managed quality assurance protocols, and ensured seamless knowledge transfer between internal and external teams.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Delivered the company’s first external batch of robots, meeting customer specifications and timelines.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Innovating Robot Hardware Design</h3>
        <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Q-Bot’s robots required design improvements to address operational inefficiencies.</p>
        <p><strong>Actions:</strong> My team spearheaded hardware updates and developed sealing retrofits to address recurring faults.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Reduced catastrophic faults by 19%, improving reliability and longevity of the robots.</p>
      </div>

    </section>

    <!-- Data-Driven Decision Making Section -->
    <section id="data-driven-decision-making">
      <h2>Data-Driven Decision Making</h2>
      <p>Leveraging data to inform decisions has been key to optimising operations and driving innovation. I specialise in identifying trends and translating insights into actionable strategies.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Reducing Robot Faults Through Data Analysis</h3>
        <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A high rate of faults was affecting robot reliability and customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Actions:</strong> My team analysed fault data to identify patterns, implemented training programmes for field teams, and introduced targeted hardware improvements.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Reduced fault rates by 48%, leading to significant cost savings and improved customer satisfaction.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- STEM Outreach Section -->
