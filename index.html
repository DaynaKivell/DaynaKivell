    <section id="about">
      <h2>My Learnings from Over a Decade of Helping Build a Startup</h2>
      <p>For the past 11 years, I’ve been part of an incredible journey: helping take a bold idea that didn’t exist in the UK market and turning it into a reality that’s now improving lives, homes, and the environment. The startup I’ve worked with has pioneered a robotic tool to install underfloor insulation—an idea that, at the time, felt like science fiction. Fast forward, and it’s now been installed in over 5,000 homes across the UK, helping families reduce heating bills, stay warm, and cut carbon emissions.</p>

      <p>This journey has not only been about innovation but also about solving real-world problems, creating jobs, and enabling robots to do what they do best: working in unsafe environments. The robot we developed ensures that humans don’t have to crawl into tight, hazardous underfloor spaces, allowing them to focus on safer, more rewarding tasks.</p>

      <p> Along the way, we’ve had to innovate at every step:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigating ever-evolving building regulations.</li>
        <li>Proving our product through rigorous experimentation in labs and real-world homes.</li>
        <li>Pushing boundaries to make something that wasn’t just functional but transformational.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Lessons from the Startup Journey</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>The Right Team is Everything:</strong> A startup’s success depends on its people. Hiring isn’t just about skills—it’s about finding individuals who align with the company’s values and vision. A cohesive, efficient team can achieve far more than even the most talented individuals working in silos.</li>
        <li><strong>Grit and Determination:</strong> Startups require relentless perseverance. It’s not just about riding the highs but navigating the lows—when progress feels slow or obstacles seem insurmountable. Success isn’t linear; it’s built on countless small wins and hard-earned lessons.</li>
        <li><strong>Commercialisation of a Product:</strong> Building something groundbreaking is only half the battle; people need to see its value and want to buy it. It’s about listening to the market, understanding your customer’s real problems, and adapting the solution to meet their needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovate Through Rapid Iteration:</strong> The fastest way to build a great product is to get it into customers’ hands as soon as possible. Rapid prototyping, early testing, and continuous iteration are essential. Failing fast isn’t about embracing failure—it’s about accelerating learning. By integrating design, engineering, and user feedback in tight loops, you refine products quickly, adapt to real-world needs, and outpace the competition.</li>
        <li><strong>Core Values as a Compass:</strong> A startup’s core values and goals should act as its North Star. When everyone aligns with those values, it creates unity and purpose that drives progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus with Perspective:</strong> Staying laser-focused on your company’s mission and goals is essential, but so is keeping an eye on the competition. You don’t need to copy what others are doing, but understanding the market landscape helps you position your company effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Listening Matters:</strong> Great ideas don’t always come from the top. Listening to your team, customers, and stakeholders fosters a culture of collaboration and innovation. People need to feel heard to feel invested.</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate the Wins:</strong> Startups can be fast-paced and demanding, but it’s important to pause and celebrate achievements. Recognising hard work boosts morale, builds loyalty, and creates momentum for the next challenge.</li>
    </ol>

      <p>These lessons reflect more than just building a business—they’ve shaped how I approach problem-solving, leadership, and collaboration. Being part of a journey that transformed an idea into a tangible, impactful product has been nothing short of extraordinary.</p>
